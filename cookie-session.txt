PHP session and cookie

A session is a way of storing information in variables across the web pages, but the information is not stored on the user's machine (computer), unlike cookie. Simple syntax to start a session in PHP is to type the command

session_start();

A session usually starts when a user opens the application via the browser and closes when the user closes the browser.

A cookie, on the other hand, is a file that the server embedded into the user's machine (computer) in order to identify a user on a website or web app whenever there is a request. A cookie variable can be created and retrieved.
We create a cookie by the below command which takes some arguments, but the name argument is required of all arguments while others are optional.

setcookie();

A cookie value can be retrieved with the global variable $_COOKIE.
The isset() function can also be used to check if a cookie is set.
